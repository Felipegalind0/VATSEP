## Background on Propellers
Propellers have been traditionally designed to generate thrust by accelerating air or water behind them. However, their performance is often compromised by various factors such as tip vortex, which leads to efficiency losses. The aim of any propeller design is, therefore, to minimize these losses while maximizing thrust.

## Toroidal Propellers
Toroidal propellers offer a fundamental shift from conventional designs. By looping back onto themselves, they aim to minimize the tip vortex usually generated by the rotating blades. This reduction in vortex-induced drag promises higher efficiency levels compared to traditional designs.

## About VATSEP
VATSEP brings an additional layer of innovation by introducing a continuously variable angle of attack across the propeller span. The design is based on a NACA 24 12 profile, and the angle of attack ranges from 30° near the center to 10° at the tip, optimizing lift across the entire span.

## Design Features
- **Variable Angle of Attack**: Allows the propeller to generate efficient lift across various operational conditions.
- **Span-Efficient**: Designed to optimize lift distribution across the entire span of the blade.
- **Toroidal Structure**: Minimizes tip vortex, thereby reducing induced drag.

## Validation and Performance Metrics
Initial CFD simulations indicate a noticeable improvement in efficiency and thrust when compared to traditional and even existing toroidal designs. Comprehensive validation data will be available upon completion of ongoing tests.

## Use Cases
VATSEP has a wide range of potential applications, including but not limited to:
- Drones
- Small Aircraft
- Marine Propulsion
- Wind Turbines
